Deep Copy: The deepCopy method creates a new instance of the object and recursively copies all its fields and nested objects.
This ensures that the copied object is completely independent of the original, preventing unintended side effects.

Arbitrary Complexity: The implementation handles objects of arbitrary complexity. It traverses nested fields and collections dynamically,
without needing to know the structure of the object in advance.

Closed Type System: It accounts for the closed type system of Java by checking for primitive types, arrays, collections, 
and maps, ensuring that all types of fields are properly handled during the deep copy process.

Recursive Data Structures: The implementation handles recursive data structures by keeping track of visited objects and avoiding infinite recursion.
